## âœ… **Debug Data Removed & Sample Data Added**

### **What We've Done:**

1. **Removed All Debug Code:**
   - Removed extensive console logging
   - Removed authentication status checking
   - Removed Firestore access testing
   - Removed debug UI elements
   - Cleaned up unused imports and variables

2. **Enhanced Sample Audio Data:**
   - **3 Complete Audio Series** with realistic content
   - **9 Total Episodes** across all series
   - **Proper Episode Structure** with episode numbers, durations, and descriptions
   - **Realistic Audio URLs** using SoundHelix sample audio
   - **Proper Categorization** (Sunday Service, Morning Devotion, Evening Devotion)

### **Sample Data Structure:**

#### **Series 1: Sunday Service Messages (4 episodes)**

### **How It Works:**

1. **App tries to load from Firestore first**
2. **If no data found, uses sample data automatically**
3. **Sample data provides immediate functionality**
4. **Users can see episodes with vertical gold banners**
5. **All audio controls work with sample data**
