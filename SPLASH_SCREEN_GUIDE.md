### **📱 Splash Screen Assets Needed:**

You need to create a `splash-logo.png` file in `assets/images/` with these specifications:

#### **Splash Logo Requirements:**
- **Size:** 512x512 pixels (square)
- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Design:** Professional logo with "MC" or your church logo
- **Background:** Transparent
- **Colors:** Use your brand colors (#c9a961, #ffffff)
- **Style:** Clean, modern, professional

#### **Recommended Design:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
│       MC        │  <- Large, bold initials
│                 │
│   Mvama Connect │  <- App name below
│                 │
└─────────────────┘
```

### **🛠️ Implementation Details:**

#### **1. Splash Screen Flow:**
```
App Launch → Custom Splash Screen → Font Loading → Main App
```

#### **2. Animation Sequence:**
1. **0-800ms:** Logo fades in and scales up
2. **800-1400ms:** Text slides up and fades in
3. **1400-2900ms:** Loading animation
4. **2900ms+:** Transition to main app

- **Responsive Design:** Works on all screen sizes

### **🎯 Brand Consistency:**

The splash screen now perfectly matches your app's design:
- ✅ **Same black background** as your app icon
- ✅ **Golden accent color** (#c9a961) throughout
- ✅ **Professional typography** using your app fonts
- ✅ **Consistent spacing** and layout principles
- ✅ **Modern animations** that feel premium

### **📋 Next Steps:**

1. **Create the splash logo** (`assets/images/splash-logo.png`)
2. **Test the splash screen** on your device
3. **Adjust timing** if needed (currently 2.9 seconds total)
4. **Customize colors** if you want different accent colors

### **🎨 Logo Creation Tips:**

For the best results, create your splash logo with:
- **High contrast** between logo and background
- **Clean, simple design** that works at small sizes
- **Professional typography** if using text
- **Your brand colors** for consistency
- **Transparent background** for flexibility

The splash screen now provides a professional, branded experience that perfectly matches your app's design language! 🎵✨
